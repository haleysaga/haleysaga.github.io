As frightening as that prospect sounds, we both could not be more excited. We have committed to making sure that this year is our year, and the culmination of this effor will be a new life in August. While we have had our share of struggles, I know that moving forward we will be more motivated than ever to overcome and end up stronger for it.

This blog will serve as the repository for news, pictures, and information about the progress of the pregnancy, and hopefully into the life of our child. To get started on the right foot, below you will find the first images we ever had of a new Haley, including his (no, we don't know yet, it's just easier to pick one) heartbeat.

Please feel free to contact either Kadi or myself in person for any additional information, but for quick updates, do check in frequently here. Thank you to friends and family for all the support we have received in the past, and from which our child will benefit in the future.
