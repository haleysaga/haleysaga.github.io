This is the 18th week of pregnancy, which also marks entry into the 5th month. Things are still rolling smoothly along. My “bump” is the main topic of conversation at work with comments daily on how much bigger I am getting. Thanks guys.

The little one is still swimming happily and ordering cheeseburgers on a somewhat decreased, but still fairly regular schedule.

Not too much new to add. We will be getting our second ultrasound at the end of next week. Ryan and I are looking forward to actually seeing the baby once again.

Then a trip to the north country is scheduled for later in the month to visit some family and show off my ever growing belly.
