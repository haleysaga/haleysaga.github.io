title: Check-Up Check-In
lead: So in the thirteenth week, baby and mother both get a check-up and initial blood work is reviewed.

And I am happy to report that both have come back with top marks. Blood work is clean, Kadi's vitals are good, and the baby is now big enough to hear with just the hand doppler. The heartbeat is strong at about 150 beats per minute.

As a milestone, fingerprints and vocal chords are developing, and baby's instestines begin their journey to their final abdominal destination.

There's not much else to report at this point, but there will be another small update in a month, and a *big* one in two months when we have the anatomical sonogram.

Stay tuned.
